# Sprint-3-PHP-and-Patterns
**Descripció** S3.01. SOLID
Level 1, 2 and 3 (all exercices)

Apply SOLID principles by refactoring source code.
In this installment, we propose code refactoring exercises (improving existing code to make it better quality) 
to begin to understand in practice how to apply the SOLID principles.
Therefore, you will start with previously written source code that you will have to analyze, understand, 
and then refactor in accordance with each of the principles.
